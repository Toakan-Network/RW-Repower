&lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt; This mod was originally Created by Texel.&lt;/color&gt;
&lt;color=green&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a continuation of the a with a long history of Maintainers. I would like to attribute them:&lt;/b&gt;  
- Texel (Original Author - 0.16)
- EbonJaeger (Previous Maintainer 1.0 - 1.3)
- Mlie (Previous Maintainer - Complete Rewrite 1.1 - 1.5)
&lt;/color&gt;

This version has been majorly rewritten to be more automatic, supporting mods by default when using inheritable Definitions, and providing more ways to extend through XML Patches or definitions.

Original Description:
Rebalance power consumption based on when an object is in use.

Generally speaking, power consumers will use substantially reduced power when not in use, and substantively more power when in use. Power consumption will accordingly vary wildly based on usage, rather than the vanilla behaviour of simply how many worktables or doors you have.

Buildings should run at 10% power when not in use, unless they have an idlePower setting defined.
